# Vim


Very good documentation â†’ [vim tips and tricks: registers](https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/\~kuperman/help/vim/registers.html)


```
noremap ; l
noremap l k
noremap k j
noremap j h
```

## Clipboard

- `"*y` copy current line/selection to clipboard register

Use `:set paste` to avoid autoindent when pasting snippets.
Then revert back using `:set nopaste`.

## Registers

Very handy when you want to get back what you've --deleted--

- `:reg` to see all of them
- `"3p` to paste content to 3rd register

## Buffers

- `:ls` will show your open buffers
- `:b` <number> will open the specified buffer in the current pane.

## Search and replace

- `%s`: all lines
- `s`: current line onlye
- `a,bs`: line a to b (inclusive)
- `.,$s`: current line (.) to end
- `.,+ns`: current line (.) to n line below
